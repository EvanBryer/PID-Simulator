## Features
Variable kP, kI, kD, friction, threshold for I to be active, max velocity, acceleration, and jerk. Gravity is also customizable inside the code, but will only affect the friction calculations. To update the values in the code, click the button next to the respective value after changing. This also allows for it to change in real time, not requiring a restart to show the affects.
